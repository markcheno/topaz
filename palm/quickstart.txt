To create a script, simply press the "New" button on the main form. You will now be in the editor form. Generally scripts start with a comment followed by one or more statements. Comments begin with "#" and continue until the next carriage return. The main form will display the first line of a script as the script title. Follow the initial comment with one or more statements.  
A simple script is:

# HelloWorld
println("Hello World")

To execute the script, press the "Run" button. If there are any errors, you will be notified.

After a script completes executing, you can return to the editor or the main form by selecting Menu|Goto
